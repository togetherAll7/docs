# Button

```jsx
<A11y
  role="button"
  description="Send email"
  activationMsg="Sending email" ... />
```

Uses the `pointer` cursor. Special attributes: `activationMsg`.

This role is meant to emulate the behaviour of a button or a togglable button. It will display a cursor pointer when your cursor is over the linked 3D object. It will call a function on click but also on any kind of action that would trigger a focused button (Enter, Double-Tap, ...). It is also actionnable by user using a screen reader.
