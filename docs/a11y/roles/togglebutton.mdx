# ToggleButton

This is mostly the same as the [button role](/a11y/roles/button).
The difference is that this button will have the aria-pressed attribute and that you'll be able to use the following properties deactivationMsg in addition to the usual description and activationMsg properties.

Since this role is meant to emulate the behaviour of togglable button.
It will display a cursor pointer when your cursor is over the linked 3D object.
It will call a function on click but also on any kind of action that would trigger a focused button (Enter, Double-Tap, ...).
It is also actionnable by user using a screen reader.

```jsx
<A11y
  role="togglebutton"
  description="Dark theme"
  startPressed={false}
  actionCall="()=>switchTheme()"
  ...>
  <Some3DComponent />
</A11y>
```

Using it like this makes it focusable to all kind of users. It will also show a pointer on mouse over.

You should also use the useA11y() hook within the encapsulated components to adjust the rendering on hover and focus.
Take a look at this code sample to see how to use it.
You can also play with it in [this demo](https://n4rzi.csb.app)

```jsx
function Some3DComponent() {
  const a11y = useA11y()
  return (
    <mesh>
      <boxBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial
        metalness={1}
        roughness={0.8}
        color={a11y.focus || a11y.hover ? '#cc66dd' : '#ffffff'}
        emissive={a11y.focus ? '#cc4444' : a11y.hover ? '#339922' : '#003399'}
      />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

You can also specify the optional prop `activationMsg` and `deactivationMsg`.
Respective message will be announced by screenreader when the button is activated / deactivated.
