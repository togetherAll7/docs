title: TransformControls
---

This class can be used to transform objects in 3D space by adapting a similar interaction model of DCC tools like Blender. Unlike other controls, it is not intended to transform the scene's camera.

TransformControls expects that its attached 3D object is part of the scene graph.

```jsx
<TransformControls>
  <Box>
    <meshBasicMaterial attach="material" />
  </Box>
</TransformControls>
```
