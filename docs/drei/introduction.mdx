A growing collection of useful helpers and abstractions for [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

```bash
npm install @react-three/drei
```

ðŸ‘‰ this package is using the stand-alone [`three-stdlib`](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) instead of [`three/examples/jsm`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm). ðŸ‘ˆ

### Basic usage:

```jsx
import { PerspectiveCamera, PositionalAudio, ... } from '@react-three/drei'
```

### React-native:

```jsx
import { PerspectiveCamera, PositionalAudio, ... } from '@react-three/drei/native'
```

The `native` route of the library **does not** export `Html` or `Loader`. The default export of the library is `web` which **does** export `Html` and `Loader`.
