The `Canvas` object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

const App = () => (
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <sphereBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
    </mesh>
  </Canvas>
)
```

The props available for the canvas are:

| Prop            | Description                                                             | Default                                                  |

| camera          | Props that go into the default camera, or your own THREE.Camera         | `{ fov: 75, near: 0.1, far: 1000, position: [0, 0, 5] }` |
| shadows         | Props that go into gl.shadowMap, can also be set true for PCFsoft       | `false`                                                  |

| onPointerMissed | Response for pointer clicks that have missed a target                   | `() => {}`                                               |

### Defaults that the canvas component sets up

Canvas will create a _translucent WebGL-renderer_ with the following properties:

- pixelratio=1
- antialias=true
- alpha=true
- powerPreference="high-performance"
- setClearAlpha(0)
- A perspective cam: `fov: 75, near: 0.1, far: 1000, z: 5, lookAt(0,0,0)`
- A orthographic cam if `orthographic` is true: `near: 0.1, far: 1000, z: 5, lookAt(0,0,0)`
- A shadowMap if `shadowMap` is true: `type: PCFSoftShadowMap`
- A scene (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a raycaster
- A [resize observer](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-measure): `scroll: true, debounce: { scroll: 50, resize: 0 }`

<Hint>
  The colorspace will be set to sRGB (unless "linear" is true), all colors and textures will be
  auto-converted. Consult https://www.donmccurdy.com/2020/06/17/color-management-in-threejs for more
  information about this. Unless "flat" is true it will set up THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping for
  slightly more contrast.
