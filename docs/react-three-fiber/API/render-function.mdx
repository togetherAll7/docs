As of version 6 you may use a render function, similar to how react-dom and all the other React renderers work. This allows you to shave off react-dom (~40kb), react-use-measure + resize-observer-polyfill (~5kb) and, if you don't need them, pointer-events (~7kb) (you need to explictely import `events` and add them to the config otherwise).

The render functions config has the same options and properties as `Canvas`, but you are responsible for resizing it. It requires an existing dom `<canvas>` object into which it renders.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render, events } from '@react-three/fiber'

window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
  render(<mesh />, document.querySelector('canvas'), {
    events,
    size: { width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight },
  })
)

window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'))
```

To unmount and dispose of all the memory that has been acquired:

```jsx
import { unmountComponentAtNode } from '@react-three/fiber'

unmountComponentAtNode(document.querySelector('canvas'))
```
