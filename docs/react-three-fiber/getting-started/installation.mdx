```bash
yarn add three @react-three/fiber
# or
npm install three @react-three/fiber
```

> Fiber is compatible with React v16.8+ and works with ReactDOM and React Native.

Getting started with React Three Fiber is not nearly has hard as you might have thought, but various frameworks may require particular attention.
We've put together guides for getting started with each popular framework:

- Create React App
- Next.js
- Gatsby

If you just want to give it a try, fork this [example on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rrppl0y8l4?file=/src/App.js)!

## Create React App

`create-react-app` will work out of the box, nothing special here!

_Add mention of official create-react-app template_

## Next.js

You can use Fiber on next by installing the `next-transpile-modules` module:

```bash
yarn add next-transpile-modules -D
# or
npm install next-transpile-modules --save-dev
```

Then, add this to your `next.config.js`

```js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['three'])

module.exports = withTM()
```
