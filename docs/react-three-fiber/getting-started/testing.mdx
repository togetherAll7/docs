## Hello world

An Enum is similar to a scalar type, but it can only be one of several values defined in the schema. Enums are most useful in a situation where the user must pick from a prescribed list of options. Additionally enums improve development velocity, since they will auto-complete in tools like GraphQL Playground.

## A section

### Another section for you

Responses whose overall cache policy scope is `PRIVATE` are shared only among sessions with the same session ID. Private responses are not cached if the `sessionId` hook is not defined or returns null.

Responses whose overall cache policy scope is `PUBLIC` are shared separately among all sessions with `sessionId` null and among all sessions with non-null `sessionId`. Caching these separately allows you to have different caches for all logged-in users vs all logged-out users, if there is easily cacheable data that should only be visible to logged-in users.

Responses containing GraphQL errors or no data are never cached.

The plugin allows you to define a few more hooks to affect cache behavior for a specific request. All hooks take in a `GraphQLRequestContext`.

- `extraCacheKeyData`: this hook can return any JSON-stringifiable object which is added to the cache key. For example, if your API includes translatable text, this hook can return a string derived from `requestContext.request.http.headers.get('Accept-Language')`.
- `shouldReadFromCache`: if this hook returns false, the plugin will not read responses from the cache.
- `shouldWriteToCache`: if this hook returns false, the plugin will not write responses to the cache.

In addition to the [`Cache-Control` HTTP header](#serving-http-cache-headers), the response cache plugin will also set the `Age` HTTP header to the number of seconds the value has been sitting in the cache.
