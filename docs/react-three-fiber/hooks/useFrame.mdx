```jsx
useFrame((callback: (state, delta) => void), (renderPriority: number = 0))
```

Allows you to execute code on every frame rendered, like running effects, updating controls, and so on. You receive the state (same as `useThree`) and a clock delta. Your callback function will be invoked just before a frame is rendered.

```jsx
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

const Controls = () => {
  const controls = useRef()

  /* Invoke the OrbitControls' update function on every frame */
  useFrame(() => controls.current.update())

  return <orbitControls ref={controls} />
}
```

If you need more control over the order in which `useFrame` callbacks are executed (and frames are rendered), you may pass a numerical `renderPriority` value; callbacks will be executed in order of ascending priority values (lowest first, highest last.)

Using a non-zero render priority will cause react-three-fiber to disable its automatic rendering, and it will be your responsibility to render explicitly:

```jsx
useFrame(({ gl, scene, camera }) => gl.render(scene, camera), 1)
```
