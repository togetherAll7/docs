# Installation

```bash
yarn add three react-three-fiber
# or
npm install three react-three-fiber
```

> Fiber is compatible with React v16.8+ and works with ReactDOM and React Native.

Getting started with React Three Fiber is simple, but various frameworks may require particular attention.
We've put together guides for getting started with each popular framework:

- Create React App
- Next.js
- Gatsby

  If you just want to give it a try, fork this [simple example on codesandbox]()!

## Create React App

`create-react-app` will work out of the box, nothing special here!

*Add mention of official create-react-app template*

## Next.js

You can use Fiber on next by installing the `next-transpile-modules` module:

```bash
yarn add next-transpile-modules -D
# or
npm install next-transpile-modules --save-dev
```

Then, add this to your `next.config.js`

```js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['three'])

module.exports = withTM()
```
